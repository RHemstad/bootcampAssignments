A quadratic equation is a type of polynomial equation of the second degree. The general form is:

ax^2 + bx + c = 0

Here, x is an unknown variable, and a, b, and c are constants. Note that "a" must not be zero; if a is zero, then the equation is linear, not quadratic.

The name "quadratic" comes from the word "quadrate," which means "square." In the equation, the highest power of the variable is 2 (which represents a square in terms of geometry).

Quadratic equations can have zero, one, or two real solutions, which can be found using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

Where:

"sqrt" represents the square root function,
"±" means that there will be two solutions: one with "+" and one with "-".
If the term "b^2 - 4ac" (known as the discriminant) is positive, then there are two distinct real solutions. If it is zero, then there is exactly one real solution. If it's negative, then there are no real solutions (the solutions are complex or imaginary numbers).
